### Cost Monitoring & Alerting

#### Key Cost Metrics to Monitor

1. **Lambda Duration Anomalies**

   ```cloudwatch
   Metric: AWS/Lambda Duration
   Alert: > 80% of timeout setting
   ```

2. **SQS Request Volume Spikes**

   ```cloudwatch
   Metric: AWS/SQS NumberOfMessagesSent
   Alert: > 2x baseline for 15 minutes
   ```

3. **DynamoDB Throttling**

   ```cloudwatch
   Metric: AWS/DynamoDB ThrottledRequests
   Alert: > 0 for 5 minutes
   ```

4. **API Gateway 4XX/5XX Rates**
   ```cloudwatch
   Metric: AWS/ApiGateway 4XXError, 5XXError
   Alert: > 5% error rate
   ```

### Free Tier Considerations

#### AWS Free Tier Benefits (First 12 months)

| Service     | Free Tier                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Lambda      | 1M free requests/month, 400K GB-seconds |
| SQS         | 1M requests/month                       |
| DynamoDB    | 25GB storage, 25 WCUs, 25 RCUs          |
| API Gateway | 1M API calls/month                      |
| CloudWatch  | 3 dashboards, 10 alarms, 5GB logs       |
| EventBridge | 1M events/month                         |

#### Optimizing for Free Tier

1. **Stay within limits**

   - Monitor usage daily
   - Set billing alerts at $0.01 threshold
   - Use dev environments for testing

2. **Leverage Always Free services**
   - S3 Standard-IA for log archiving
   - CloudFormation for infrastructure management
   - IAM for security (no cost)

### Cost Anomaly Detection

#### Unexpected Cost Spikes Indicators

1. **Infinite Loops**

   - Sudden spike in Lambda invocations
   - Rapidly growing SQS queue depth
   - High error rates in logs

2. **Misconfigured Resources**

   - Excessive CloudWatch logging
   - Unintentional retries causing amplification
   - Missing TTL on DynamoDB records

3. **Security Issues**
   - Unauthorized API usage
   - DDoS attacks on API Gateway
   - Excessive scanning of DynamoDB

#### Cost Monitoring Dashboard

Create a CloudWatch dashboard with widgets:

#### Cost Allocation Tags

Implement tagging strategy:

- `Project: IngestionLab`
- `Environment: dev/staging/prod`
- `Team: DevOps`
- `CostCenter: Engineering`

### Reserved Capacity Considerations

#### When to Consider Reserved Capacity

1. **Predictable Production Workloads**

   - Consistent message volume
   - Stable function execution patterns
   - Long-term commitment (1-3 years)

2. **DynamoDB Provisioned Capacity**
